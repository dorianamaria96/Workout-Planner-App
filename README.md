# Workout Planner App - Gainz Repository
Welcome to the Workout Planner App! This app allows you to plan and track your workouts, with access to a wide variety of exercises from an external API. You can filter exercises by type, difficulty, and muscle, and use them to build custom workout routines.

## Technologies Used
### Backend
The backend of the app was developed using Java with Maven and Spring Boot, and the data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. JPA was used to handle object-relational mapping between the Java objects and the database tables. Spring Security was used to handle user authentication and authorization, ensuring that all data is kept secure.

### Frontend
The frontend of the app was developed using React with TypeScript. The app uses React Router for client-side routing. JavaScript's built-in Fetch API was used to make requests to the backend API, and CSS was used to style the app and provide pre-built UI components.

## Installation
To use the app, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
— Navigate to the backend directory, and after setting up the environment variables for the database, start the Spring Boot app.
— Navigate to the frontend directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
— Run `npm start` to start the frontend development server.

Please note that this project is currently a work in progress and is not yet complete. While the app is fully functional, some features may be incomplete or may not function as intended. 

Thank you for using the Workout Planner App!
